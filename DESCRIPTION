Description: The mirtjml package provides powerful functions for solving modern high
  dimensional item factor analysis problem. For dataset with large number of examinees,
  items and when the latent dimension becomes very high, the traditional methods become
  unusable due to the computation burden. Even for the state-of-art method like MH-RM,
  the estimation for dataset with sample size N=1e4, item size J=1e3 is still beyond 
  it's capability. The package uses alternating minimization algorithm for the 
  optimization procedure and multiprocessing OpenMP API is utilized to unshackle the
  computing power on the modern multi-core machines. For example, the package can fit
  a dataset (do an exploratory item factor analysis) with 125,000 respondents, 
  500 items, and 10 latent traits within 3 minutes on a single 
  IntelÂ® machine(i7CPU@5650U@2.2 GHz.) with four cores.
